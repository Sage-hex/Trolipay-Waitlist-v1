# Trolipay Landing — Color & Visual Communication Guide

## 1) Core Brand Palette (from spec tokens)

- `brand-primary` — `#0F172A` (Infrastructure Slate)
- `brand-accent` — `#047857` (Muted Emerald)
- `app-bg` — `#F8FAFC`
- `card-bg` — `#FFFFFF`
- `border` — `#E5E7EB`
- `text` — `#111827`
- `text-muted` — `#6B7280`

## 2) How the premium look is achieved

The page stays token-compliant but uses stronger composition:

- Layered background treatment with subtle radial blends using brand-primary + brand-accent alpha values.
- High-contrast hero typography over soft gradients.
- Premium card rhythm: `rounded-xl border border-border bg-card-bg shadow-sm p-6`.
- Dark trust strip using `bg-brand-primary` with soft inset cards.
- Accent-driven iconography (`text-brand-accent`) for directional emphasis.

## 3) Usage map in the landing

- Primary narrative + CTA emphasis: `text-brand-primary`, `bg-brand-primary`, `text-white`
- Interaction highlights + trust indicators: `text-brand-accent`, `ring-brand-accent`
- Surface consistency: `bg-app-bg`, `bg-card-bg`, `border-border`
- Readability hierarchy: `text-text`, `text-text-muted`

## 4) Messaging guide used in the redesign

The landing now communicates Trolipay in investor-ready language:

- Problem: chat-native sales without a commerce system lead to operational leakage and payment uncertainty.
- Solution: Trolipay is the infrastructure layer that turns chat demand into verifiable orders.
- Outcome: deterministic totals, webhook payment truth, and receipt-backed trust.

## 5) Copy principles applied

- Short, high-clarity statements.
- Operational language over hype language.
- Distinct sections for problem, solution, and mechanism.
- Retained dual CTA flow: waitlist + demo.
